<h1> Who we are 🤔 </h1>

Glider is a student research group operating at AGH UST, Kraków. We are focusing on developing open-source AI solutions to help with everyday tasks of some facilities and people education about programming and AI algorithms.

Group name is inspired by the famous Conway's game of life, where Glider is the name of the simplest shape that is able to travel between other shapes and create new ones. 

The fact that you, traveller, are here suggest that maybe you are a Glider too.
